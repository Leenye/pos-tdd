### Get started with POS-TDD in Jasmine

First you need to clone this repo to you local machine

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:zhen639/pos-tdd.git
```
Write your function in src/main.js
Then run SpecRunner.html to check your code
If pass, you should refactor your code and write the second test for me 

GOOD LUCK
